UTA Data Analytics Bootcamp

Module 19 - Unsupervised Learning
CryptoClustering




## Description

This contains my submission for module 19 of the UTA Data Analytics Bootcamp. We were tasked with completing a supplied jupyter notebook that would test the use of unsupervised learning techniques (k-means, PCA).


## Requirements

To be able to run the jupyter notebooks, you will need the following libraries:

-   holoviews
-   pandas
-   sklearn
  
The project was run using Python 3.10.13. 

## Installation

Install by cloning the repo and using the tool of your choice to handle the jupyter notebook. 

## Repo Overview 

`/Resources/` contains the csv file that was used to populate the data for our notebook.

`Crypto_Clustering.ipynb` is the jupyter notebook of interest.
